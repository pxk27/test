# Stats Reset Tests

These tests check that stats reset when m5.stats.reset() is called. Detailed
information about each test can be found at the top of each file in
`stats-reset/configs`.

To run these tests by themselves, you can run the following command in the
tests directory:

```bash
./main.py run gem5/stats-reset
```
